            <h2>Critical Streaming Improvements in Version 0.3.7.0</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">
                <div class="date">April 12, 2025</div>
                <div class="tag">Technical</div>
            </div>

            <p>We've made significant technical improvements to the core streaming and metadata systems in version 0.3.7.0, released on April 12, 2025. These changes enhance reliability and performance, especially during long listening sessions.</p>
            
            <h3>Technical Improvements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Metadata Fetching:</strong> Fixed critical issues in how we handle asynchronous operations during error scenarios, preventing UI freezes and improving reliability.</li>
                <li><strong>Better Connection Stability:</strong> Streaming connections now recover more gracefully from network interruptions with improved error recovery mechanisms.</li>

                <li><strong>Code Structure Improvements:</strong> Restructured async code flow to prevent potential deadlocks during metadata retrieval, a common cause of application hangs in previous versions.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>While most of these changes happen behind the scenes, you'll notice faster connections to stations, more reliable song information display, and better overall performance, especially when using multiple features simultaneously.</p>

            <h2>Database Search and Usability Improvements in Version 0.3.6.0</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">
                <div class="date">April 11, 2025</div>
                <div class="tag">Feature</div>
            </div>
     
            <p>Version 0.3.6.0 brings several enhancements to our LB Database functionality, making it easier to find and manage your stations while tracking usage data more comprehensively.</p>
            
            <h3>Database Enhancements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Station Search:</strong> Added the ability to search for stations directly within the database, making it easier to find favorites in large collections.</li>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive Data Tracking:</strong> Non-favorite stations now track data usage too, giving you complete visibility into your listening habits.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Data Management:</strong> Deleting a station from favorites will automatically add its data usage to "Non-favorites data usage" to maintain accurate statistics.</li>
                <li><strong>Visual Improvements:</strong> "Non-favorites data usage" now displays in light green color for easier identification, and the UI has received several small adjustments for better usability.</li>
                <li><strong>Focused Statistics:</strong> When viewing usage statistics for specific dates, only stations that were actually played during that period will be shown, reducing clutter.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We've also added a confirmation message when enabling or disabling statistics tracking to prevent accidental changes that might affect your usage data (version 0.3.6.2).</p>
            
            <h3>Theme Designer Additions</h3>
            <p>For theme customization enthusiasts, we've added two new buttons in the theme designer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Randomize All Colors:</strong> Generate a completely random theme with one click</li>
                <li><strong>Randomize Selected Elements:</strong> Only randomize specific aspects of your theme</li>

            <h2>Visual Experience Upgrade in Version 0.3.5.0</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">
                <div class="date">April 9, 2025</div>
                <div class="tag">Enhancement</div>
            </div>
          
            <p>We've enhanced the visual experience in version 0.3.5.0 with two significant improvements:</p>
            
            <h3>Theme Consistency</h3>
            <p>Themes will now apply to all forms and windows throughout the application. Previously, some dialogs and panels might not have fully adopted your selected theme, creating visual inconsistency. Now your chosen theme will be applied everywhere for a cohesive experience.</p>
            
            <h3>Smooth Transitions</h3>
            <p>All forms now have a fade-in effect for a more polished and professional feel. Rather than windows appearing instantly, they'll smoothly transition into view, reducing visual jarring when opening new panels or dialogs.</p>
            
            <p>These subtle but important visual improvements contribute to a more refined and professional application experience.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Version 0.3.3.0 represents a significant milestone with the introduction of our comprehensive database system for tracking statistics and managing favorites.</p>
            
            <h3>The LB Database</h3>
            <p>We've implemented a sophisticated database that tracks and manages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Play Time:</strong> Detailed tracking of how long you've listened to each station</li>
                <li><strong>Play Count:</strong> How many times you've connected to each station</li>
                <li><strong>Data Usage:</strong> Estimates of how much bandwidth each station has consumed</li>
                <li><strong>Favorites Management:</strong> Improved organization of your favorite stations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This feature is entirely optional and can be disabled if you prefer not to track your listening statistics.</p>
            
            <h3>Theme Designer Overhaul</h3>
            <p>We've completely reworked the theme designer UI with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intuitive Layout:</strong> More logical organization of color selection options</li>
                <li><strong>Color Picker:</strong> Added a precise color selection tool for fine-tuning your themes</li>
                <li><strong>Better Preview:</strong> Improved visual feedback when designing themes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We've also improved memory management and resource cleanup throughout the application, and in version 0.3.3.1, we've added proper error dialogs that will show Windows crash information if an unexpected error occurs.</p>
