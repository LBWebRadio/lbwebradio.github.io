    <h2>Version 0.8.0.0 Released: Major Database Overhaul & Enhanced Reliability</h2>
    <div class="blog-meta">
        <div class="date">October 19, 2025</div>
        <div class="tag">Major Update</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.8.0.0 represents a major leap forward in database reliability and data integrity. This release focuses on ensuring your listening history and favorites are always safely stored with extensive improvements to how the application handles database operations. We've also squashed several critical crashes and made meaningful refinements throughout the application.</p>
    
    <h3>Bulletproof Database Checkpoint System</h3>
    <p>The database checkpoint system has been completely rebuilt with automatic retry logic that ensures your data is always properly saved. When performing major database operations the system now attempts multiple retries if the initial save fails. This means your listening history and station data are protected even in edge cases where database writes might encounter temporary issues. The new system monitors the save process and won't proceed with critical operations until it confirms everything is safely written to disk.</p>
    
    <h3>Enhanced Database Lock Handling</h3>
    <p>We've added robust handling for database locks and busy states throughout the application. While these are edge cases that most users won't encounter the new protection ensures smooth operation even when multiple processes need database access simultaneously. The application now intelligently waits and retries rather than failing when the database is temporarily busy.</p>
    
    <h3>Safe Database Import Operations</h3>
    <p>A critical bug has been fixed where importing a database could cause corruption if WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) files were present in the database directory during the import. The import process now properly handles these temporary database files and ensures background processes complete their work before performing the import. This prevents any potential data corruption and makes database restoration completely reliable.</p>
    
    <h3>Complete Database Export</h3>
    <p>Database exports now force a complete checkpoint before creating the backup file. This ensures that all recent changes are included in the export even if they haven't been written to the main database file yet. When you export your database you can be confident that absolutely everything up to that exact moment is captured in the backup. No more wondering if your most recent listening session made it into the export.</p>
    
    <h3>Fail-Safe Shutdown Process</h3>
    <p>The application shutdown sequence has been significantly enhanced with retry logic for database saves. When you close Live Beats WRP the system now makes multiple attempts to ensure all your data is properly saved before the application exits. While there were no known issues with data loss before this additional layer of protection provides peace of mind that your listening history and settings are always preserved. The shutdown process won't complete until it confirms everything is safely written to disk.</p>
    
    <h3>Reduced Risk of Data Loss</h3>
    <p>All these database improvements work together to dramatically reduce any risk of data loss during normal operation. Whether you're importing a backup or shutting down the application or experiencing unexpected system conditions your data remains protected. The combination of retry logic and careful checkpoint management means your listening history and favorites are safer than ever.</p>
    
    <h3>Clearer Database Operation Messages</h3>
    <p>We've improved the information messages displayed during database import and export operations. The messages now clearly explain what's happening at each step and provide better context about the process. This helps you understand what the application is doing with your data and removes any uncertainty about database operations.</p>
    
    <h3>Preserved Database Creation Date</h3>
    <p>The database creation date is now properly preserved when clearing error logs from the database information viewer. Previously this date would be reset when clearing the log data. The creation date is now treated as permanent metadata that survives maintenance operations.</p>
    
    <h3>Critical Crash Fixes</h3>
    <p>This release fixes a crash that could occur when closing the Advanced Radio Browser if the main application was already in the shutdown process. The browser window now detects when shutdown is in progress and closes gracefully without attempting operations on resources that are being cleaned up. We've also eliminated a rare null reference crash in a background task that could occur under specific timing conditions.</p>
    
    <h3>Auto-Stop Protection Fix</h3>
    <p>An issue has been resolved where unmuting the player wouldn't properly reset the auto-stop protection timer. The 30-minute muted playback protection now correctly resets when you unmute ensuring the feature works as intended. You won't experience unexpected stops after unmuting if you had previously been playing muted.</p>
    
    <h3>Enhanced Station Information Display</h3>
    <p>The database information and error log viewer now displays the full stream URL alongside each monitored station name. Previously only station names were shown which made troubleshooting difficult if an incorrect URL format made its way into the favorites system. The complete URL display helps identify any problematic links and provides better insight into which exact streams are being tracked in your database.</p>
    
    <h3>Improved Station Website Button</h3>
    <p>The station website button now includes intelligent filtering that removes invalid and placeholder URLs before attempting to open them. We've enhanced the URL validation with better protection against malformed links that could cause errors. The button only activates for legitimate website addresses ensuring you never encounter broken links or error dialogs.</p>
    
    <h3>Smarter Random Station Selection</h3>
    <p>The play random station button in the favorites search window now avoids selecting the same station consecutively. If you're already listening to a station and press the random button it will pick something different from your filtered results. This makes the random feature more useful for discovering other stations in your collection.</p>
    
    <h3>Performance Improvements</h3>
    <p>Data usage tracking has been optimized for better stability and performance. We've also cached the regex pattern used for bitrate parsing which eliminates wasteful object recreation on every parse operation. These behind-the-scenes optimizations contribute to smoother overall performance.</p>
    
    <h3>Intuitive Label Change</h3>
    <p>The "Time Played" label shown when connected to a station has been renamed to "Streaming". This more accurately describes what's happening and feels more intuitive. You're streaming the station rather than playing back a fixed duration of content.</p>
    
    <h3>Manual Temporarily Unavailable</h3>
    <p>Please note that the Live Beats manual is currently disabled while we work on a completely new version. The updated manual is under construction and will be available soon with comprehensive coverage of all the latest features and improvements.</p>
    
    <div class="update-cta">
        <p>Version 0.8.0.0 is a major milestone focused on data integrity and application stability. The extensive database improvements ensure your listening history and favorites are protected under all conditions. Combined with critical crash fixes and thoughtful refinements throughout the application this release provides a more reliable and polished experience.</p>

    <h2>Version 0.7.9.4 Released: Smart Favorites Search & Improved Metadata Handling</h2>
    <div class="blog-meta">
        <div class="date">October 17, 2025</div>
        <div class="tag">Update</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.7.9.4 brings significant enhancements to the favorites search experience with new playback options and intelligent window behavior. This release also includes important fixes for metadata handling and data usage tracking, making your radio listening experience more reliable and enjoyable.</p>
    
    <h3>Random Station Playback from Search Results</h3>
    <p>The favorites search window now features a dedicated button to play a random station from your filtered search results or just from all your favorites. This feature adds an element of discovery to your listening experience. Let Live Beats WRP surprise you with a random selection from your curated favorites that match your current search criteria, making it easier to explore your favorites.</p>
    
    <h3>Live Station Count Display</h3>
    <p>Never wonder how many stations match your search again. The favorites search window now displays the total number of stations in your current search results giving you instant feedback on how your filters are working. This real-time counter updates as you typee.</p>
    
    <h3>Persistent Search Window Option</h3>
    <p>We've added a new checkbox that allows you to keep the favorites search window open after selecting a station. This is perfect for users who like to browse through multiple stations in quick succession or want to keep their favorites list accessible while listening. The setting is automatically saved, so your preference persists across sessions. Choose the workflow that suits you best—close on selection for a streamlined experience, or keep it open for continuous browsing.</p>
    
    <h3>Smart Station Pre-Selection</h3>
    <p>When you open the favorites search window, Live Beats WRP now  pre-selects the currently playing favorite station if one is active. This makes it easy to see which station you're listening to within your favorites list and provides a convenient starting point for browsing similar stations or switching to something new. The selection happens automatically, creating a more contextual and intuitive search experience.</p>
    
    <h3>Enhanced Now Playing Text Scrolling</h3>
    <p>Long messages in the media info window no longer get cut off or become unreadable. The "Now Playing" display now features automatic scrolling when text exceeds the available space, ensuring you can always read complete information no matter how lengthy. The scrolling is smooth and continuous making it easy to catch all the details about what's currently playing without any manual intervention.</p>
    
    <h3>Graceful Metadata Retry Handling</h3>
    <p>We've completely reworked the metadata retry function to be more respectful of streaming servers. Previously if metadata fetching failed the system could make repeated rapid requests that put unnecessary load on the server. The new implementation handles failures gracefully with intelligent backoff timing and preventing server hammering while still ensuring you get metadata updates when they become available. This improves both reliability and good network citizenship.</p>
    
    <h3>Fixed Data Usage Tracking</h3>
    <p>The "Data Used" label now correctly displays bandwidth consumption even when Live Beats defaults to estimating 160kbps bitrate for stations that don't provide explicit bitrate information. Previously the data usage wouldn't count in these scenarios, making it difficult to track your bandwidth consumption. This fix ensures accurate monitoring of your data usage across all station types, giving you better control and awareness of your network usage.</p>
    
    <div class="update-cta">
        <p>Version 0.7.9.4 focuses on making the favorites search experience more powerful and flexible while ensuring accurate metadata and data tracking. The random playback feature adds spontaneity to your listening, the persistent window option accommodates different browsing styles, and the pre-selection makes navigation more intuitive. Combined with the improved scrolling display and more reliable metadata handling this update enhances both discovery and reliability.</p>
        <p>Version 0.7.9.4 is available now for all users. Download the latest version from our <a href="download.html">download page</a>.</p>

            <h3>Refined Muted Playback Notifications</h3>
            <p>Building on the auto-stop feature introduced in version 0.7.8.0, we've improved the user experience when playback has been muted for 30 minutes. Instead of an intrusive messagebox that demands immediate attention, the notification is now more subtle and less disruptive to your workflow. The player will stop gracefully with a notification that doesn't interrupt what you're doing, making the feature feel more natural and less jarring.</p>
            
            <h3>Enhanced Debug Tools & Volume Guidance</h3>
            <p>The debug information window has been upgraded with a refresh button that allows you to update diagnostics on demand, plus a clear errors button for managing your error log.

This simple addition prevents confusion and helps new users understand why they can't hear audio, improving the overall onboarding experience.</p>
            
            <h3>Visual & UI Improvements</h3>
            <p>HTTP and HTTPS protocol icons have been slightly reduced in size to fit better within the user interface, creating a cleaner and more balanced visual appearance. These small refinements contribute to a more polished look throughout the application.</p>
            
            <h3>Label Scrolling Rework</h3>
            <p>Label scrolling behavior has been completely reworked for better usability. Scrolling text now automatically pauses when you hover your mouse over a label, allowing you to read station names, song titles, or other information without distraction. When you move your mouse away, scrolling resumes naturally. This intuitive behavior makes it much easier to interact with and read scrolling content throughout the application.</p>
            
            <h3>Stability & Code Quality Improvements</h3>
            <p>This release includes general code cleanup and refinement that improves overall maintainability and prepares the codebase for future enhancements. Form animation code has been reviewed and made more consistent, resulting in smoother transitions throughout the interface. We've fixed a critical issue where the error logging system could crash when handling missing information, ensuring that error tracking remains reliable even in unusual situations. The Copy and Save Song buttons now appear correctly when reconnecting to the same station, and we've enhanced thread safety in button visibility updates to prevent potential crashes during rapid state changes.</p>

            <h2>Version 0.7.6.6 Released: Enhanced Database Management & Real-Time Search</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">
                <div class="date">October 6, 2025</div>
                <div class="tag">Database Update</div>
            </div>

            <p>The database now automatically selects non-favorite stations when they're playing, in addition to the existing favorite station selection. When you play a non-favorite station, the database will automatically highlight the corresponding "Non-favorites data usage" row (marked in green), making it easier to quickly view and manage statistics for any currently playing station regardless of its favorite status.</p>
            
            <h3>Real-Time Search Filtering</h3>
            <p>Search functionality in the database view has been significantly enhanced with real-time filtering. Results now filter instantly as you type, eliminating the need to press Enter or click the Search button. The Search button now doubles as a quick "Clear" button when filtering is active, providing a seamless search experience.</p>
            
            <h3>Improved Interface Clarity</h3>
            <p>We've changed the text from "Pin Window" to "Pin Player" for better clarity about what this feature actually does. The pin functionality keeps your player window always on top, and the new label makes this purpose more immediately understandable to users.</p>
            
            <h3>Interactive Copyright Label</h3>
            <p>The copyright label in the application is now clickable and includes a helpful tooltip. Clicking the label copies the support email address to your clipboard and displays a confirmation message, making it easier to reach out for support or feedback.</p>
            
            <h3>Registration System Improvements</h3>
            <p>We've made various enhancements to the registration system to improve security, reliability, and user experience. These improvements work behind the scenes to ensure smoother registration and licensing processes.</p>
            
            <h3>Database Security Patches</h3>
            <p>This release includes important security patches for the database system, ensuring your station data and listening statistics remain secure and protected.</p>

            <h2>Version 0.7.6.0 Released: Performance Optimization & Smart Database Maintenance</h2>
    <div class="blog-meta">
        <div class="date">October 2, 2025</div>
        <div class="tag">Performance Update</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.7.6.0 introduces intelligent performance optimizations that work behind the scenes to keep your listening experience fast and responsive. This release focuses on server efficiency, database health, and streamlined user interface elements.</p>
    
    <h3>Optimized Server Caching</h3>
    <p>Radio station searches are now significantly faster thanks to enhanced server caching mechanisms. The application intelligently reduces file system access, resulting in quicker station discovery and improved overall responsiveness when browsing your favorite stations.</p>
    
    <h3>Streamlined Interface</h3>
    <p>The Import/Export favorites tooltip has been refined by removing the "Settings" reference. Since Live Beats now uses the database exclusively for all settings storage, this change provides clearer, more accurate information about what the import/export functionality actually handles.</p>
    
    <h3>Automatic Database Optimization</h3>
    <p>Perhaps the most significant addition in this version is the self-maintaining database system. Every 7 days, Live Beats automatically optimizes its database to maintain peak performance and responsiveness throughout extended usage.</p>
    
    <h3>Behind the Scenes: How Your App Stays Fast and Healthy</h3>
    <p>Ever notice how some apps start fast when you first install them, but over time they get slower, heavier, or even a little buggy? That usually happens because the app's database — the "brain" where all your information is stored — gets cluttered and needs cleaning.</p>
    
    <p>Live Beats WRP has a built-in self-maintenance system that takes care of this automatically, without you ever needing to push a button. Here's how it works, behind the scenes:</p>
    
    <h4>1. A Quick Check When You Start Listening</h4>
    <p>When you play a radio station for the first time in a session, Live Beats runs a quick internal check. This is like a warm-up routine — making sure everything is working correctly before you keep listening.</p>
    
    <h4>2. Weekly Database Maintenance</h4>
    <p>Once that first check is done, the app also looks at when it last performed database maintenance. If it's been more than seven days, it immediately starts a background cleanup.</p>
    
    <p>This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tidying up unused space so the database doesn't bloat unnecessarily</li>
        <li>Reorganizing data so it can be read more quickly</li>
        <li>Refreshing performance statistics so that Live Beats knows the best way to retrieve your information</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Think of it like reorganizing a messy filing cabinet — your documents are still there, but now they're easier and faster to find. And don't worry: all your favorites, themes, and settings remain safely saved during this process.</p>
    
    <h4>3. No Interruptions, No Popups</h4>
    <p>All of this happens silently. The app won't interrupt your music with popups or technical warnings. If maintenance is needed, it runs quietly in the background while you enjoy your radio station. Once it's complete, you'll see a small success message (about once every 7 days) letting you know the database has been optimized. This process was designed with you in mind: minimal impact and maximum benefit.</p>
    
    <h4>4. Smarter Scheduling</h4>
    <p>The app keeps track of the last time maintenance was done. If it's too soon to run again, it waits — ensuring the process only happens when it's actually needed.</p>
    
    <h4>5. Manual Maintenance (Optional)</h4>
    <p>If you ever want to run database maintenance yourself, you can do so from the Database window in the app. Most users will never need this since the process happens automatically in the background — but if you want to, running it manually won't hurt anything. It's just an extra tune-up on demand.</p>
    
    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    
    <h4>Do I need to run this myself?</h4>
    <p>Nope! Maintenance happens automatically every 7 days. The manual option is there if you want to use it, but it's not required.</p>
    
    <h4>Will this slow down my computer while I'm listening?</h4>
    <p>Not noticeably. The process is designed to be quick and silent. In most cases, you won't even know it's happening.</p>
    
    <h4>Why does it trigger when I play a radio station?</h4>
    <p>Because that's the moment the app knows you're actively using it. It's the perfect time to check if maintenance is due without slowing things down during loading.</p>
    
    <h4>What's the benefit for me as a listener?</h4>
    <p>Faster load times, smoother playback, and a database that doesn't grow unnecessarily large. Basically, your app stays just as responsive as the day you first installed it.</p>
    
    <h4>What if something goes wrong during maintenance?</h4>
    <p>The process is designed to fail silently — meaning if there's ever a rare issue, the app won't interrupt your listening experience.</p>
    
    <h4>Do I need to wait until maintenance is done before I exit Live Beats?</h4>
    <p>No. If you close the app during maintenance, it will simply stop and pick up again later when needed. You don't have to keep the app open for it to complete.</p>
    
    <div class="update-cta">
        <p>In short: the next time you hit "play" on your favorite radio station, know that the app is quietly working behind the scenes to keep itself fast, clean, and optimized — and if you ever feel like giving it a little extra boost, you can run maintenance manually anytime from the Database window.</p>

            <h2>Version 0.7.5.1 Released: Enhanced User Experience with Integrated Search</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">
                <div class="date">September 24, 2025</div>
                <div class="tag">Feature Update</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.7.5.1 introduces a highly requested feature that transforms how users interact with their favorite radio stations. This update focuses on enhancing user experience through intelligent search functionality and improved application stability.</p>
            
            <h3>Enhancing User Experience: Adding an Integrated Search Button to Favorites</h3>
            <p>One of the most requested features from our users has been the ability to quickly search through your favorite radio stations. Today, we're excited to share how we implemented a sleek, integrated search button that transforms your favorites management.</p>
            
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>Standard dropdown menus work great for short lists, but when you have hundreds of favorites finding what you want becomes tedious. Users were constantly scrolling through lengthy favorites lists, and the built-in type-ahead functionality wasn't quite cutting it for complex search scenarios.</p>
            
            <h3>The Solution: Integrated Search Button</h3>
            <p>We developed a custom search button that appears seamlessly integrated into the favorites dropdown and now finding your favorite station among hundreds of favorites becomes easy and quick. Once you find the station you just double click to start playing.</p>
            
            <h3>Smart Functionality</h3>
            <p>Maintains dropdown functionality - your original favorites menu still works perfectly. Added through checks for valid favorites imports and URLs used in the player.</p>
            
            <h3>Application Improvements</h3>
            <p><strong>Memory Management Enhancement:</strong> Fixed several potential memory leak issues where system resources weren't being properly released when the application closed. This prevents the app from consuming unnecessary memory and improves overall system performance.</p>
            
            <h3>Station Monitoring System Improvements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Random Timing Improvements:</strong> Updated how the app generates random intervals between metadata checks. The previous method was inefficient and could produce poor randomization. Now uses a more efficient approach that provides better distribution of update times.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Cleanup Architecture:</strong> Implemented multiple cleanup points throughout the application: immediate cleanup when features are disabled, comprehensive cleanup when closing forms, and automatic cleanup for temporary operations.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This ensures system resources are freed as soon as they're no longer needed, rather than waiting until the application exits.</p>
            
            <h3>Overall Impact</h3>
            <p>These improvements make the application more responsive, stable, and efficient with system resources. Users should notice smoother operation, especially when using the station monitoring features with multiple stations active simultaneously.</p>

            <h2>Version 0.7.0.0 Released: Backend Revolution & Seamless Update Experience</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">
                <div class="date">September 18, 2025</div>
                <div class="tag">Major Update</div>
            </div>

            <h2>Version 0.6.1.0 Released: Quality of Life Improvements & Enhanced User Experience</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">
                <div class="date">September 12, 2025</div>
                <div class="tag">Update</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>We're excited to announce Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.6.1.0, a focused quality-of-life update that addresses user feedback and enhances the daily listening experience. This release fine-tunes key interface behaviors, optimizes system resource usage, and provides clearer user options for favorite station management.</p>
            
            <h3>Homepage Button Intelligence</h3>
            <p>The homepage button now properly clears when switching to stations without websites, eliminating the confusing behavior where previous station URLs would linger when the new station doesn't broadcast any website information. This ensures the homepage button always reflects the current station's actual web presence, providing accurate and relevant links every time.</p>
            
            <h3>Optimized Volume Settings</h3>

Previously, volume changes were saved immediately, causing unnecessary disk operations during active listening. This optimization improves overall system performance while maintaining reliable volume persistence across sessions.</p>
            
            <h3>Enhanced Radio Browser Integration</h3>
            <p>Radio Browser stations now intelligently manage favorites selection - the favorites dropdown properly clears when playing non-favorite stations while correctly maintaining selection for stations that are actually in your favorites list. This prevents confusion about which playback mode is active and ensures accurate statistics tracking.</p>
            
            <h3>Improved User Interface Responsiveness</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Non-Modal About Dialog:</strong> The About dialog is now non-modal, allowing you to continue using the main player interface while viewing version information and changelog details.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Button Focus:</strong> Disabled buttons now bring focus to the interface instead of being completely unresponsive, providing better visual feedback and maintaining interface responsiveness even when certain functions are temporarily unavailable.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Clearer Favorite Station Playback</h3>
            <p>When playing Radio Browser stations that are already in your favorites, you now get clear, accurate options: play from favorites without reporting to the Radio Browser API, or play from favorites while also reporting the vote to the API. Both options ensure your listening statistics are properly tracked, with the choice simply determining whether to contribute data back to the Radio Browser community.</p>
            
            <p>Version 0.6.1.0 builds on the solid foundation of 0.6.0.0 with these targeted improvements that make daily radio listening more intuitive and efficient. These refinements ensure every interaction feels natural and responsive while maintaining the robust stability and feature completeness that defines Live Beats WebRadio Player.</p>

            <h3>Intelligent Song Recording</h3>
            <p>Say goodbye to metadata clutter with our new intelligent song recording system. Song titles must now remain stable for 5 seconds before being recorded to history, effectively filtering out glitchy metadata, streaming errors, and rapid title changes that previously cluttered your song history. This ensures only genuine, stable song information makes it to your permanent listening record.</p>
            
            <h3>Enhanced Favorites Management</h3>
            <p>Your top favorites now permanently stay at the top of your favorites list, making your most-loved stations instantly accessible.

            <h3>Rock-Solid System Stability</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive Resource Management:</strong> All timers, audio streams, and system resources are now cleaned up safely with extensive under-the-hood improvements that prevent memory leaks and system instability.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimized Memory Handling:</strong> The application no longer forces aggressive memory cleanup operations, resulting in smoother performance and reduced system strain during extended listening sessions.</li>
                <li><strong>Lightning-Fast Operations:</strong> Stopping stations and closing the application is now significantly faster and smoother, eliminating the delays and stuttering that could occur during shutdown operations.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Intelligent Error Recovery</h3>
            <p>When fatal errors occur, the application now offers an intelligent automatic restart option instead of simply crashing. This user-friendly approach ensures minimal disruption to your listening experience while providing you with a clear choice about how to handle unexpected situations, maintaining your control over the application's behavior.</p>
            
            <h3>Enhanced Database Reliability</h3>
            <p>Extensive database function improvements make the entire system more robust and reliable. These enhancements ensure your song history, favorites, and settings are consistently saved and retrieved accurately, providing a dependable foundation for all your listening data and preferences.</p>
            
            <h3>Smart Duplicate Prevention</h3>
            <p>The song history system now intelligently ignores duplicate entries from the same station for 200 minutes, dramatically reducing metadata repetition while preserving genuine listening variety. This smart filtering ensures your history accurately reflects your actual listening experience without redundant entries.</p>
            
            <h3>Streamlined User Experience</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fixed User Messages:</strong> Resolved issues where user message functionality would intermittently stop working, ensuring consistent communication and feedback throughout your listening sessions.</li>
                <li><strong>Stable Interface During Monitoring:</strong> The player interface is now locked during station monitoring expansion to prevent accidental interruptions that could halt the monitoring process.</li>
                <li><strong>Corrected Song Info Handling:</strong> Fixed the bug where saving song information from the LB Database history would incorrectly set it as the current title in the main player interface.</li>
                <li><strong>Customizable Startup:</strong> Registered users can now choose to disable the greeting message on application startup, creating a cleaner, more personalized launch experience.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Version 0.6.0.0 represents our most comprehensive stability and usability update to date, focusing on the fundamental aspects of daily radio listening while strengthening every core system. These improvements ensure Live Beats WebRadio Player provides an enterprise-level reliable foundation wrapped in an intuitive, user-focused interface.</p>

            <p>We're thrilled to announce Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.5.6.0, a significant stability-focused release that addresses critical performance issues, enhances stream handling, and delivers rock-solid reliability improvements that our users have been requesting. This update represents our commitment to providing the most stable radio streaming experience possible.</p>
            
            <h3>Rock-Solid Timer Stability</h3>
            <p>The Time Played timer has been completely overhauled and is now incredibly stable without any skipping or timing irregularities. This fundamental improvement ensures accurate tracking of your listening sessions and eliminates the frustrating timer jumps that could occur in previous versions.</p>
            
            <h3>Enhanced Text Scrolling Performance</h3>
            <p>We've resolved all scrolling issues affecting song titles, station names, and user messages. Text now flows smoothly across the interface without stuttering, jerking, or display artifacts, creating a much more polished and professional user experience.</p>
            
            <h3>Intelligent Favorites vs Radio Browser Playback</h3>
            <p>A powerful new feature gives you complete control when a station exists in both your favorites and the radio browser. The application now presents you with the choice to play from favorites (for personal tracking) or from the radio browser (allowing you to send votes and support stations). This flexibility ensures you can engage with stations exactly how you want while maintaining your personal listening statistics.</p>
            
            <h3>Critical Stream Handling Fixes</h3>
            <p>We've eliminated a potentially serious deadlock issue in stream reader disposal that could cause the entire application to freeze. The new implementation includes robust timeout protection (2 seconds) for all network stream cleanup operations and a completely improved disposal process that properly handles base stream closure, preventing hangs and ensuring smooth operation even with problematic network conditions.</p>
            
            <h3>Enhanced User Communication</h3>
            <p>User messages have been expanded throughout the application to provide better feedback for various operations. You'll now receive clear, informative messages that keep you informed about what the application is doing, from import operations to network status updates, making the entire experience more transparent and user-friendly.</p>
            
            <h3>Radio Browser Stability Improvements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thread Safety:</strong> Completely resolved thread safety issues when populating radio browser filter dropdowns, eliminating crashes and unexpected behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>API Rate Limiting Fix:</strong> Solved duplicate radio browser form initialization that was causing API rate limiting issues, ensuring consistent access to station data.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Loading Stability:</strong> Country, language, and tag loading in the radio browser is now significantly more stable and reliable.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Immediate Favorites Tracking</h3>
            <p>Fixed the frustrating issue where adding a station to favorites required restarting the station to begin proper tracking. Station tracking now immediately switches from non-favorite to favorite mode the moment you add a station to your favorites list. Additionally, imported favorite stations are now properly tracked without requiring an application restart, making the favorites system truly seamless.</p>
            
            <h3>Refined Import Experience</h3>
            <p>The settings panel will no longer unexpectedly open when performing drag-and-drop operations to import favorites files. The panel now only closes after import if it was already open before the operation, maintaining a cleaner and more predictable user interface behavior.</p>
            
            <h3>Polish & Professional Appearance</h3>
            <p>Removed the distracting focus rectangles that appeared on buttons when switching between applications, creating a cleaner, more professional appearance that maintains visual consistency regardless of application focus state.</p>
            
            <p>Version 0.5.6.0 demonstrates our dedication to delivering enterprise-level stability and reliability in a consumer-friendly package. These improvements address the core issues that affect daily usage, ensuring Live Beats WebRadio Player provides the smooth, dependable experience you deserve.</p>

This improvement makes it easier to keep track of songs you discover during your listening sessions.</p>

            </div>
     
            <p>Version 0.3.6.0 brings several enhancements to our LB Database functionality, making it easier to find and manage your stations while tracking usage data more comprehensively.</p>
            
            <h3>Database Enhancements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Station Search:</strong> Added the ability to search for stations directly within the database, making it easier to find favorites in large collections.</li>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive Data Tracking:</strong> Non-favorite stations now track data usage too, giving you complete visibility into your listening habits.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Data Management:</strong> Deleting a station from favorites will automatically add its data usage to "Non-favorites data usage" to maintain accurate statistics.</li>
                <li><strong>Visual Improvements:</strong> "Non-favorites data usage" now displays in light green color for easier identification, and the UI has received several small adjustments for better usability.</li>
                <li><strong>Focused Statistics:</strong> When viewing usage statistics for specific dates, only stations that were actually played during that period will be shown, reducing clutter.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We've also added a confirmation message when enabling or disabling statistics tracking to prevent accidental changes that might affect your usage data (version 0.3.6.2).</p>
            
            <h3>Theme Designer Additions</h3>

            </div>
          
            <p>We've enhanced the visual experience in version 0.3.5.0 with two significant improvements:</p>
            
            <h3>Theme Consistency</h3>
            <p>Themes will now apply to all forms and windows throughout the application. Previously, some dialogs and panels might not have fully adopted your selected theme, creating visual inconsistency. Now your chosen theme will be applied everywhere for a cohesive experience.</p>
            
            <h3>Smooth Transitions</h3>
            <p>All forms now have a fade-in effect for a more polished and professional feel. Rather than windows appearing instantly, they'll smoothly transition into view, reducing visual jarring when opening new panels or dialogs.</p>
            
            <p>These subtle but important visual improvements contribute to a more refined and professional application experience.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Version 0.3.3.0 represents a significant milestone with the introduction of our comprehensive database system for tracking statistics and managing favorites.</p>
            
            <h3>The LB Database</h3>
            <p>We've implemented a sophisticated database that tracks and manages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Play Time:</strong> Detailed tracking of how long you've listened to each station</li>

            <h3>Theme Designer Overhaul</h3>

                <li><strong>Intuitive Layout:</strong> More logical organization of color selection options</li>
