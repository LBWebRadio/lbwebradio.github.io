            <h2>Version 0.6.1.0 Released: Quality of Life Improvements & Enhanced User Experience</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">
                <div class="date">September 12, 2025</div>
                <div class="tag">Update</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>We're excited to announce Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.6.1.0, a focused quality-of-life update that addresses user feedback and enhances the daily listening experience. This release fine-tunes key interface behaviors, optimizes system resource usage, and provides clearer user options for favorite station management.</p>
            
            <h3>Homepage Button Intelligence</h3>
            <p>The homepage button now properly clears when switching to stations without websites, eliminating the confusing behavior where previous station URLs would linger when the new station doesn't broadcast any website information. This ensures the homepage button always reflects the current station's actual web presence, providing accurate and relevant links every time.</p>
            
            <h3>Optimized Volume Settings</h3>
            <p>Volume settings are now saved only when the application exits, significantly reducing resource usage during playback sessions. Previously, volume changes were saved immediately, causing unnecessary disk operations during active listening. This optimization improves overall system performance while maintaining reliable volume persistence across sessions.</p>
            
            <h3>Enhanced Radio Browser Integration</h3>
            <p>Radio Browser stations now intelligently manage favorites selection - the favorites dropdown properly clears when playing non-favorite stations while correctly maintaining selection for stations that are actually in your favorites list. This prevents confusion about which playback mode is active and ensures accurate statistics tracking.</p>
            
            <h3>Improved User Interface Responsiveness</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Non-Modal About Dialog:</strong> The About dialog is now non-modal, allowing you to continue using the main player interface while viewing version information and changelog details.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Button Focus:</strong> Disabled buttons now bring focus to the interface instead of being completely unresponsive, providing better visual feedback and maintaining interface responsiveness even when certain functions are temporarily unavailable.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Clearer Favorite Station Playback</h3>
            <p>When playing Radio Browser stations that are already in your favorites, you now get clear, accurate options: play from favorites without reporting to the Radio Browser API, or play from favorites while also reporting the vote to the API. Both options ensure your listening statistics are properly tracked, with the choice simply determining whether to contribute data back to the Radio Browser community.</p>
            
            <p>Version 0.6.1.0 builds on the solid foundation of 0.6.0.0 with these targeted improvements that make daily radio listening more intuitive and efficient. These refinements ensure every interaction feels natural and responsive while maintaining the robust stability and feature completeness that defines Live Beats WebRadio Player.</p>
            
            <div class="update-cta">
                <p>Version 0.6.1.0 is available now for all users. Download the latest version from our <a href="download.html">download page</a>.</p>

            <h2>Version 0.6.0.0 Released: History Management & System Stability Revolution</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">
                <div class="date">September 11, 2025</div>
                <div class="tag">Update</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>We're proud to announce Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.6.0.0, a comprehensive stability and usability update that revolutionizes history management, enhances system reliability, and delivers the most robust radio streaming experience we've ever created. This release addresses core user workflow improvements while significantly strengthening the application's foundation.</p>
            
            <h3>Revolutionary History Management</h3>
            <p>Take complete control of your listening history with our new advanced history management system. You can now clear all history with a single action or precisely manage individual entries using intuitive right-click context menus to delete specific songs or sessions. This granular control ensures your history stays exactly how you want it, whether you prefer a clean slate or selective curation of your listening experience.</p>
            
            <h3>Intelligent Song Recording</h3>
            <p>Say goodbye to metadata clutter with our new intelligent song recording system. Song titles must now remain stable for 5 seconds before being recorded to history, effectively filtering out glitchy metadata, streaming errors, and rapid title changes that previously cluttered your song history. This ensures only genuine, stable song information makes it to your permanent listening record.</p>
            
            <h3>Enhanced Favorites Management</h3>
            <p>Your top favorites now permanently stay at the top of your favorites list, making your most-loved stations instantly accessible. Combined with improved station switching reliability that properly resets favorites and scrolling states when changing stations, managing and accessing your preferred content has never been smoother or more predictable.</p>
            
            <h3>Rock-Solid System Stability</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive Resource Management:</strong> All timers, audio streams, and system resources are now cleaned up safely with extensive under-the-hood improvements that prevent memory leaks and system instability.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimized Memory Handling:</strong> The application no longer forces aggressive memory cleanup operations, resulting in smoother performance and reduced system strain during extended listening sessions.</li>
                <li><strong>Lightning-Fast Operations:</strong> Stopping stations and closing the application is now significantly faster and smoother, eliminating the delays and stuttering that could occur during shutdown operations.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Intelligent Error Recovery</h3>
            <p>When fatal errors occur, the application now offers an intelligent automatic restart option instead of simply crashing. This user-friendly approach ensures minimal disruption to your listening experience while providing you with a clear choice about how to handle unexpected situations, maintaining your control over the application's behavior.</p>
            
            <h3>Enhanced Database Reliability</h3>
            <p>Extensive database function improvements make the entire system more robust and reliable. These enhancements ensure your song history, favorites, and settings are consistently saved and retrieved accurately, providing a dependable foundation for all your listening data and preferences.</p>
            
            <h3>Smart Duplicate Prevention</h3>
            <p>The song history system now intelligently ignores duplicate entries from the same station for 200 minutes, dramatically reducing metadata repetition while preserving genuine listening variety. This smart filtering ensures your history accurately reflects your actual listening experience without redundant entries.</p>
            
            <h3>Streamlined User Experience</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fixed User Messages:</strong> Resolved issues where user message functionality would intermittently stop working, ensuring consistent communication and feedback throughout your listening sessions.</li>
                <li><strong>Stable Interface During Monitoring:</strong> The player interface is now locked during station monitoring expansion to prevent accidental interruptions that could halt the monitoring process.</li>
                <li><strong>Corrected Song Info Handling:</strong> Fixed the bug where saving song information from the LB Database history would incorrectly set it as the current title in the main player interface.</li>
                <li><strong>Customizable Startup:</strong> Registered users can now choose to disable the greeting message on application startup, creating a cleaner, more personalized launch experience.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Version 0.6.0.0 represents our most comprehensive stability and usability update to date, focusing on the fundamental aspects of daily radio listening while strengthening every core system. These improvements ensure Live Beats WebRadio Player provides an enterprise-level reliable foundation wrapped in an intuitive, user-focused interface.</p>

            <h2>Version 0.5.6.0 Released: Major Stability & Performance Overhaul</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">
                <div class="date">September 6, 2025</div>
                <div class="tag">Update</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>We're thrilled to announce Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.5.6.0, a significant stability-focused release that addresses critical performance issues, enhances stream handling, and delivers rock-solid reliability improvements that our users have been requesting. This update represents our commitment to providing the most stable radio streaming experience possible.</p>
            
            <h3>Rock-Solid Timer Stability</h3>
            <p>The Time Played timer has been completely overhauled and is now incredibly stable without any skipping or timing irregularities. This fundamental improvement ensures accurate tracking of your listening sessions and eliminates the frustrating timer jumps that could occur in previous versions.</p>
            
            <h3>Enhanced Text Scrolling Performance</h3>
            <p>We've resolved all scrolling issues affecting song titles, station names, and user messages. Text now flows smoothly across the interface without stuttering, jerking, or display artifacts, creating a much more polished and professional user experience.</p>
            
            <h3>Intelligent Favorites vs Radio Browser Playback</h3>
            <p>A powerful new feature gives you complete control when a station exists in both your favorites and the radio browser. The application now presents you with the choice to play from favorites (for personal tracking) or from the radio browser (allowing you to send votes and support stations). This flexibility ensures you can engage with stations exactly how you want while maintaining your personal listening statistics.</p>
            
            <h3>Critical Stream Handling Fixes</h3>
            <p>We've eliminated a potentially serious deadlock issue in stream reader disposal that could cause the entire application to freeze. The new implementation includes robust timeout protection (2 seconds) for all network stream cleanup operations and a completely improved disposal process that properly handles base stream closure, preventing hangs and ensuring smooth operation even with problematic network conditions.</p>
            
            <h3>Enhanced User Communication</h3>
            <p>User messages have been expanded throughout the application to provide better feedback for various operations. You'll now receive clear, informative messages that keep you informed about what the application is doing, from import operations to network status updates, making the entire experience more transparent and user-friendly.</p>
            
            <h3>Radio Browser Stability Improvements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thread Safety:</strong> Completely resolved thread safety issues when populating radio browser filter dropdowns, eliminating crashes and unexpected behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>API Rate Limiting Fix:</strong> Solved duplicate radio browser form initialization that was causing API rate limiting issues, ensuring consistent access to station data.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Loading Stability:</strong> Country, language, and tag loading in the radio browser is now significantly more stable and reliable.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Immediate Favorites Tracking</h3>
            <p>Fixed the frustrating issue where adding a station to favorites required restarting the station to begin proper tracking. Station tracking now immediately switches from non-favorite to favorite mode the moment you add a station to your favorites list. Additionally, imported favorite stations are now properly tracked without requiring an application restart, making the favorites system truly seamless.</p>
            
            <h3>Refined Import Experience</h3>
            <p>The settings panel will no longer unexpectedly open when performing drag-and-drop operations to import favorites files. The panel now only closes after import if it was already open before the operation, maintaining a cleaner and more predictable user interface behavior.</p>
            
            <h3>Polish & Professional Appearance</h3>
            <p>Removed the distracting focus rectangles that appeared on buttons when switching between applications, creating a cleaner, more professional appearance that maintains visual consistency regardless of application focus state.</p>
            
            <p>Version 0.5.6.0 demonstrates our dedication to delivering enterprise-level stability and reliability in a consumer-friendly package. These improvements address the core issues that affect daily usage, ensuring Live Beats WebRadio Player provides the smooth, dependable experience you deserve.</p>

This improvement makes it easier to keep track of songs you discover during your listening sessions.</p>
            
            <p>Version 0.4.8.0 represents our continued commitment to refining the user experience through intelligent automation and thoughtful interface improvements that respect both your time and your listening preferences.</p>

            <p>We've made several small but meaningful improvements to the SLSK Download Manager, focusing on security and user experience. These refinements make the download process smoother and more reliable for users who integrate Soulseek functionality with their radio experience.</p>
            
            <h3>Robust API Connection Logic</h3>
            <p>The advanced radio browser now features more robust connection logic for improved reliability when accessing the radio-browser.info API. This enhancement ensures better connectivity and reduces the likelihood of connection timeouts or failures when searching for new stations.</p>

                <li><strong>Local Data Caching:</strong> Languages, tags, and countries are now cached locally for 72 hours, significantly decreasing the load on the radio-browser.info API while improving search response times. These cache files occupy only about 160KB on your hard drive.</li>

                <li><strong>Multi-Window Management:</strong> Opening the advanced radio browser will close the expanded player and temporarily disable the Radio Browser button to prevent multiple window conflicts.</li>
                <li><strong>Precise Volume Control:</strong> Volume adjustment using the mousewheel now changes by ±2 instead of 3, allowing for more precise fine-tuning of your listening experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Visual Customization:</strong> Added 5 darker themes for both the LB Database datagrid and Advanced search datagrid, perfect for night-time use.</li>

                <div class="date">April 11, 2025</div>
                <div class="tag">Feature</div>
            </div>
     
            <p>Version 0.3.6.0 brings several enhancements to our LB Database functionality, making it easier to find and manage your stations while tracking usage data more comprehensively.</p>
            
            <h3>Database Enhancements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Station Search:</strong> Added the ability to search for stations directly within the database, making it easier to find favorites in large collections.</li>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive Data Tracking:</strong> Non-favorite stations now track data usage too, giving you complete visibility into your listening habits.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Data Management:</strong> Deleting a station from favorites will automatically add its data usage to "Non-favorites data usage" to maintain accurate statistics.</li>
                <li><strong>Visual Improvements:</strong> "Non-favorites data usage" now displays in light green color for easier identification, and the UI has received several small adjustments for better usability.</li>
                <li><strong>Focused Statistics:</strong> When viewing usage statistics for specific dates, only stations that were actually played during that period will be shown, reducing clutter.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We've also added a confirmation message when enabling or disabling statistics tracking to prevent accidental changes that might affect your usage data (version 0.3.6.2).</p>
            
            <h3>Theme Designer Additions</h3>
            <p>For theme customization enthusiasts, we've added two new buttons in the theme designer:</p>

            </div>
          
            <p>We've enhanced the visual experience in version 0.3.5.0 with two significant improvements:</p>
            
            <h3>Theme Consistency</h3>
            <p>Themes will now apply to all forms and windows throughout the application. Previously, some dialogs and panels might not have fully adopted your selected theme, creating visual inconsistency. Now your chosen theme will be applied everywhere for a cohesive experience.</p>
            
            <h3>Smooth Transitions</h3>
            <p>All forms now have a fade-in effect for a more polished and professional feel. Rather than windows appearing instantly, they'll smoothly transition into view, reducing visual jarring when opening new panels or dialogs.</p>
            
            <p>These subtle but important visual improvements contribute to a more refined and professional application experience.</p>

                <li>If the text file is moved, renamed or deleted, you can create a new one or find and merge with the old one</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Theme Designer</h3>
