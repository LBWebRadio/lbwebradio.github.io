    <h2>Version 0.8.6.0 Released: Interface Refinements & System Integration</h2>
    <div class="blog-meta">
        <div class="date">November 13, 2025</div>
        <div class="tag">UI Enhancement</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.8.6.0 brings refined interface interactions and improved system integration with a focus on visual polish and user experience. This release enhances the application's presence in the Windows environment while adding delightful interaction animations and modern styling effects that elevate the overall interface quality.</p>
    
    <h3>Task Manager Display Name</h3>
    <p>The application now displays its proper name "Live Beats WRP" in Windows Task Manager instead of the generic "WebRadio" label that appeared previously. This improvement makes process identification easier and more professional especially when managing multiple applications. Users can now quickly locate and manage Live Beats in their system processes with clear and accurate identification that matches the application's branding.</p>
    
    <h3>Button Click Animations</h3>
    <p>Version 0.8.6.0 introduces smooth click animations for all image-based buttons throughout the interface. When you click a button with a background image the button rotates briefly providing satisfying visual feedback that confirms your interaction. The animation system uses asynchronous processing with automatic image management and proper disposal of temporary rotated images to maintain optimal memory usage.</p>
    
    <h3>Advanced Rotation System</h3>
    <p>The click animation system employs sophisticated image handling that prevents concurrent rotations on the same button and maintains references to original images for efficient return animations. Rotations are calculated using high-quality bicubic interpolation with proper alpha transparency support ensuring crisp and professional-looking animations. The system includes comprehensive error handling and validation to ensure stability even with unusual image dimensions or edge cases.</p>
    
    <h3>Glass Effect Buttons</h3>
    <p>Buttons without background images now feature a modern glass effect that creates visual depth and sophistication. The TransparentButton class has been enhanced with optional glass effect rendering that applies a subtle gradient overlay to the upper portion of buttons. This creates a glossy appearance reminiscent of modern interface design trends while maintaining excellent performance through optimized rendering techniques.</p>
    
    <h3>Enhanced Button States</h3>
    <p>The glass effect system integrates seamlessly with existing hover and press states providing dynamic visual feedback. Buttons automatically brighten when hovered and darken when pressed while preserving alpha channel transparency for proper blending with gradient backgrounds. The system intelligently adjusts gradient heights based on button dimensions ensuring optimal visual appearance across different button sizes throughout the application.</p>
    
    <h3>Gradient Background Integration</h3>
    <p>The new glass effect buttons work harmoniously with the gradient backgrounds introduced in version 0.8.5.1. Transparent button backgrounds properly inherit the parent form's gradient creating a cohesive floating appearance where interface elements blend naturally with their surroundings. This integration maintains the modern premium aesthetic while ensuring all interactive elements remain clearly visible and functional.</p>
    
    <h3>Technical Excellence</h3>
    <p>All new features in version 0.8.6.0 maintain Live Beats' commitment to performance and stability. The animation system uses efficient async/await patterns with proper resource cleanup and the glass effect rendering employs optimized graphics paths and cached brushes. The task manager integration required careful attention to application metadata and assembly properties ensuring accurate system-level identification across all Windows versions.</p>
    
    <div class="update-cta">
        <p>Version 0.8.6.0 continues Live Beats WebRadio Player's evolution with thoughtful refinements that enhance daily use. While these may seem like small details they contribute significantly to the overall polish and professional feel of the application making every interaction more satisfying and visually pleasing.</p>
        <p>Version 0.8.6.0 is available now for all users. Download the latest version from our <a href="download.html">download page</a>.</p>

        <div class="tag">Major Feature Update</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.8.5.1 introduces powerful new recording capabilities and stunning visual enhancements across the entire application along with important bug fixes. This release brings professional-grade stream recording functionality while elevating the visual experience with modern gradient designs throughout every form in the application.</p>
    
    <h3>Professional Stream Recording</h3>
    <p>The headline feature of version 0.8.5.1 is the all-new stream recorder that allows you to capture and save your favorite radio broadcasts directly to your device. Record any station from your favorites list with full control over duration and file format and metadata logging. The recorder automatically detects stream format including MP3 and AAC and OGG and OPUS and FLAC and saves with the appropriate file extension.</p>
    
    <h3>Advanced Recording Features</h3>
    <p>The stream recorder includes powerful features designed for both convenience and control. Set optional time limits for automatic recording stops or let recordings run until you manually stop them. The recorder displays real-time elapsed time and countdown timers showing exactly how long you've been recording and how much time remains if you've set a duration limit. Stream information including bitrate and format and metadata support is detected and logged automatically at the start of each recording.</p>
    
    <h3>Metadata Logging</h3>
    <p>Enable metadata logging to capture track changes during your recording session. The recorder monitors the stream's metadata and creates a timestamped log of every song or show segment that plays during recording. This log can be exported as a text file providing a complete record of what was broadcast during your recording session. Perfect for creating playlists or documenting radio shows.</p>
    
    <h3>Registration-Based Limits</h3>
    <p>The recording feature implements limits based on registration status. Unregistered users can record up to 5 minutes once per session which is perfect for trying out the feature. Registered users enjoy extended recording capabilities with up to 24 hours of continuous recording per session and unlimited recording sessions. This ensures all users can experience the recording feature while supporting the application's development.</p>
    
    <h3>Gradient Visual Revolution</h3>
    <p>Version 0.8.5.1 transforms the entire application with beautiful gradient backgrounds applied to every form. The new FormGradientBackgroundPlus class provides smooth and professional gradients that automatically adapt to your chosen theme colors. Forms now feature sophisticated two-color gradients that create visual depth and a premium modern appearance throughout the application.</p>
    
    <h3>Seamless Panel Transparency</h3>
    <p>The gradient enhancement includes automatic panel transparency handling that ensures UI panels blend seamlessly with the gradient backgrounds. The system automatically manages panel transparency and prevents visual conflicts when themes change. This creates a cohesive and polished look where interface elements float naturally over the gradient backgrounds without interrupting the visual flow.</p>

    <p>Fixed an important bug related to country flag display for streaming servers. The flag system now correctly displays geographic information for all stream sources and provides accurate visual indicators of server locations. This enhancement improves the reliability of the server location feature introduced in version 0.8.2.0.</p>
    
    <h3>Technical Excellence</h3>
    <p>The stream recorder uses efficient asynchronous recording with optimized buffering for smooth and reliable captures. Recordings are written directly to disk with proper format handling for various stream types. The gradient system employs cached brushes and efficient invalidation to maintain excellent performance even on resource-constrained systems. All new features integrate seamlessly with Live Beats' existing architecture while maintaining the application's lightweight and responsive character.</p>
    
    <div class="update-cta">
        <p>Version 0.8.5.1 represents a significant milestone for Live Beats WebRadio Player by adding professional recording capabilities while elevating the visual experience throughout the application. The combination of powerful new features and stunning visual enhancements makes this release one of the most substantial updates to date.</p>

An indicator dot and line mark the precise volume position adds subtle elegance to the interface.</p>
            
            <h3>Smooth Interactive Experience</h3>
            <p>Volume adjustments with the new knob are fluid and responsive. The control uses smooth anti-aliased rendering for crisp, professional-looking edges at any size. Click and drag anywhere on or around the knob to adjust volume with precision. The rotary interaction feels natural and satisfying, offering more control than traditional sliders while taking up the same compact space in the interface.</p>
            
            <h3>Theme Integration</h3>
            <p>The volume knob seamlessly integrates with Live Beats' existing color themes. It automatically adapts to your chosen accent color, ensuring visual consistency throughout the application. The knob's sophisticated appearance complements the modern design aesthetic of Live Beats while providing a distinctive, premium touch that sets the player apart.</p>
            
            <div class="update-cta">
                <p>Version 0.8.3.0 elevates the Live Beats user interface with a volume control that's both beautiful and functional. The new knob-styled design brings a touch of professional audio equipment aesthetics to your desktop, making volume adjustment feel more engaging and precise.</p>

    <h2>Version 0.8.1.3 Released: Update Notifications & Playlist Management</h2>
    <div class="blog-meta">
        <div class="date">October 29, 2025</div>
        <div class="tag">Minor Update</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.8.1.3 delivers improvements to the update experience and playlist management. This release introduces a redesigned update notification system and adds convenient playlist creation directly from the database interface. We've also fixed an issue that could prevent update downloads from completing successfully on retry attempts.</p>
    
    <h3>Brand New Update Notification Form</h3>
    <p>The update notification system has been completely redesigned to provide better visibility when new versions are available. The new form presents update information more clearly making it easier to see what's changed and decide when to update. The improved design ensures you won't miss important updates while maintaining a non-intrusive approach that respects your workflow. When a new version is available the notification provides all the details you need to make an informed decision about updating.</p>
    
    <h3>Fixed Update Download Retry Bug</h3>
    <p>A bug that could cause problems when retrying a failed update download has been resolved. Previously if an update download was interrupted and you attempted to retry the download the process could encounter errors. The retry mechanism now works reliably ensuring that temporary network issues or interrupted downloads don't prevent you from successfully updating Live Beats. This makes the update process more robust and reduces frustration when connectivity issues occur during updates.</p>
    
    <h3>Create Playlist from Database Context Menu</h3>
    <p>You can now create playlists directly from the LB database using a new right-click context menu option.

    <h2>Version 0.8.1.0 Released: Enhanced Error Recovery & Network Protection</h2>
    <div class="blog-meta">
        <div class="date">October 27, 2025</div>
        <div class="tag">Feature Update</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.8.1.0 brings significant improvements to error handling and network stability. This release focuses on graceful recovery from unexpected situations and better protection when your internet connection drops. We've also refined random station selection and added database maintenance tools to keep your application running smoothly over time.</p>
    
    <h3>Redesigned Error Handler</h3>
    <p>The Live Beats error handler has been completely redesigned to give you control when unexpected errors occur. Instead of simply logging the error and continuing the new handler presents four clear options: Restart the application to reset everything cleanly. View Debug Info to see technical details about what went wrong. Continue running if you believe the error won't affect your session. Or Exit the application if you prefer to stop completely. This puts you in control of how to respond to problems rather than forcing a single behavior. Hopefully you'll never need to see this dialog but if something unexpected happens you now have meaningful choices.</p>
    
    <h3>Network Connection Loss Protection</h3>
    <p>The player now detects when your internet connection drops and handles it gracefully. When network connectivity is lost during streaming the player will attempt to stop the stream cleanly rather than hanging or causing errors. A clear message appears in the player window explaining that the connection was lost. This prevents the application from getting stuck in a bad state when your network goes down and makes recovery much smoother when connectivity returns.</p>
    
    <h3>Improved Random Station Selection</h3>
    <p>The random station button has been enhanced to avoid selecting both the currently playing station and the station that was previously chosen by the random function. If you press the random button multiple times you won't get the same station back-to-back and you won't land on the station you're already listening to. This makes the random feature more useful for exploring your favorites collection.</p>
    
    <h3>Enhanced Metadata Filtering</h3>
    <p>Song title filtering has been expanded to exclude more metadata error messages from appearing in your history. When stations send malformed or error data the filter now catches these patterns and prevents them from being logged as legitimate song titles. This keeps your listening history cleaner and more accurate.</p>
    
    <h3>Database Maintenance Option</h3>
    <p>A new maintenance option allows you to delete listening records older than 12 months from your database. Over time your database can grow quite large if you listen frequently and this can impact performance. The new cleanup option helps prevent the database from becoming too large or slow. You maintain full control over when to run this cleanup and your recent listening history remains untouched.</p>
    
    <h3>UI Dialog Protection</h3>
    <p>The Save Debug Info and Clear Error Log buttons in the database viewer are now disabled while dialogs are open. This prevents UI stacking issues where multiple dialogs could appear on top of each other. The buttons re-enable automatically once the current dialog closes. This simple change eliminates confusion and ensures dialogs are handled one at a time.</p>
    
    <h3>Shutdown Process Refinement</h3>
    <p>A duplicate loop in the shutdown process has been removed. The shutdown sequence now runs more efficiently without redundant operations. This contributes to faster and cleaner application exit.</p>
    
    <h3>Updated WebView2</h3>
    <p>The WebView2 runtime has been updated to the latest version. This ensures compatibility with modern web standards and provides any security improvements from the newest release. The browser component used for displaying station websites and other web content now runs on the most current version available.</p>
    
    <div class="update-cta">
        <p>Version 0.8.1.0 strengthens Live Beats with better error recovery and network handling. The new error dialog gives you control when problems occur while the connection loss protection prevents streaming issues when your network drops. Combined with smarter random selection and database maintenance tools this release keeps your listening experience smooth and your data manageable.</p>
        <p>Version 0.8.1.0 is available now for all users. Download the latest version from our <a href="download.html">download page</a>.</p>

    <h2>Version 0.8.0.0 Released: Major Database Overhaul & Enhanced Reliability</h2>
    <div class="blog-meta">
        <div class="date">October 19, 2025</div>
        <div class="tag">Major Update</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.8.0.0 represents a major leap forward in database reliability and data integrity. This release focuses on ensuring your listening history and favorites are always safely stored with extensive improvements to how the application handles database operations. We've also squashed several critical crashes and made meaningful refinements throughout the application.</p>
    
    <h3>Bulletproof Database Checkpoint System</h3>
    <p>The database checkpoint system has been completely rebuilt with automatic retry logic that ensures your data is always properly saved. When performing major database operations the system now attempts multiple retries if the initial save fails. This means your listening history and station data are protected even in edge cases where database writes might encounter temporary issues. The new system monitors the save process and won't proceed with critical operations until it confirms everything is safely written to disk.</p>
    
    <h3>Enhanced Database Lock Handling</h3>
    <p>We've added robust handling for database locks and busy states throughout the application. While these are edge cases that most users won't encounter the new protection ensures smooth operation even when multiple processes need database access simultaneously. The application now intelligently waits and retries rather than failing when the database is temporarily busy.</p>
    
    <h3>Safe Database Import Operations</h3>
    <p>A critical bug has been fixed where importing a database could cause corruption if WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) files were present in the database directory during the import. The import process now properly handles these temporary database files and ensures background processes complete their work before performing the import. This prevents any potential data corruption and makes database restoration completely reliable.</p>
    
    <h3>Complete Database Export</h3>
    <p>Database exports now force a complete checkpoint before creating the backup file. This ensures that all recent changes are included in the export even if they haven't been written to the main database file yet. When you export your database you can be confident that absolutely everything up to that exact moment is captured in the backup. No more wondering if your most recent listening session made it into the export.</p>
    
    <h3>Fail-Safe Shutdown Process</h3>
    <p>The application shutdown sequence has been significantly enhanced with retry logic for database saves. When you close Live Beats WRP the system now makes multiple attempts to ensure all your data is properly saved before the application exits. While there were no known issues with data loss before this additional layer of protection provides peace of mind that your listening history and settings are always preserved. The shutdown process won't complete until it confirms everything is safely written to disk.</p>
    
    <h3>Reduced Risk of Data Loss</h3>
    <p>All these database improvements work together to dramatically reduce any risk of data loss during normal operation. Whether you're importing a backup or shutting down the application or experiencing unexpected system conditions your data remains protected. The combination of retry logic and careful checkpoint management means your listening history and favorites are safer than ever.</p>
    
    <h3>Clearer Database Operation Messages</h3>
    <p>We've improved the information messages displayed during database import and export operations. The messages now clearly explain what's happening at each step and provide better context about the process. This helps you understand what the application is doing with your data and removes any uncertainty about database operations.</p>
    
    <h3>Preserved Database Creation Date</h3>
    <p>The database creation date is now properly preserved when clearing error logs from the database information viewer. Previously this date would be reset when clearing the log data. The creation date is now treated as permanent metadata that survives maintenance operations.</p>
    
    <h3>Critical Crash Fixes</h3>
    <p>This release fixes a crash that could occur when closing the Advanced Radio Browser if the main application was already in the shutdown process. The browser window now detects when shutdown is in progress and closes gracefully without attempting operations on resources that are being cleaned up. We've also eliminated a rare null reference crash in a background task that could occur under specific timing conditions.</p>
    
    <h3>Auto-Stop Protection Fix</h3>
    <p>An issue has been resolved where unmuting the player wouldn't properly reset the auto-stop protection timer. The 30-minute muted playback protection now correctly resets when you unmute ensuring the feature works as intended. You won't experience unexpected stops after unmuting if you had previously been playing muted.</p>
    
    <h3>Enhanced Station Information Display</h3>
    <p>The database information and error log viewer now displays the full stream URL alongside each monitored station name. Previously only station names were shown which made troubleshooting difficult if an incorrect URL format made its way into the favorites system. The complete URL display helps identify any problematic links and provides better insight into which exact streams are being tracked in your database.</p>
    
    <h3>Improved Station Website Button</h3>
    <p>The station website button now includes intelligent filtering that removes invalid and placeholder URLs before attempting to open them. We've enhanced the URL validation with better protection against malformed links that could cause errors. The button only activates for legitimate website addresses ensuring you never encounter broken links or error dialogs.</p>
    
    <h3>Smarter Random Station Selection</h3>
    <p>The play random station button in the favorites search window now avoids selecting the same station consecutively. If you're already listening to a station and press the random button it will pick something different from your filtered results. This makes the random feature more useful for discovering other stations in your collection.</p>
    
    <h3>Performance Improvements</h3>
    <p>Data usage tracking has been optimized for better stability and performance. We've also cached the regex pattern used for bitrate parsing which eliminates wasteful object recreation on every parse operation. These behind-the-scenes optimizations contribute to smoother overall performance.</p>
    
    <h3>Intuitive Label Change</h3>
    <p>The "Time Played" label shown when connected to a station has been renamed to "Streaming". This more accurately describes what's happening and feels more intuitive. You're streaming the station rather than playing back a fixed duration of content.</p>
    
    <h3>Manual Temporarily Unavailable</h3>
    <p>Please note that the Live Beats manual is currently disabled while we work on a completely new version. The updated manual is under construction and will be available soon with comprehensive coverage of all the latest features and improvements.</p>
    
    <div class="update-cta">

    <h2>Version 0.7.9.4 Released: Smart Favorites Search & Improved Metadata Handling</h2>
    <div class="blog-meta">
        <div class="date">October 17, 2025</div>
        <div class="tag">Update</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.7.9.4 brings significant enhancements to the favorites search experience with new playback options and intelligent window behavior. This release also includes important fixes for metadata handling and data usage tracking, making your radio listening experience more reliable and enjoyable.</p>
    
    <h3>Random Station Playback from Search Results</h3>
    <p>The favorites search window now features a dedicated button to play a random station from your filtered search results or just from all your favorites. This feature adds an element of discovery to your listening experience. Let Live Beats WRP surprise you with a random selection from your curated favorites that match your current search criteria, making it easier to explore your favorites.</p>
    
    <h3>Live Station Count Display</h3>
    <p>Never wonder how many stations match your search again. The favorites search window now displays the total number of stations in your current search results giving you instant feedback on how your filters are working. This real-time counter updates as you typee.</p>
    
    <h3>Persistent Search Window Option</h3>
    <p>We've added a new checkbox that allows you to keep the favorites search window open after selecting a station. This is perfect for users who like to browse through multiple stations in quick succession or want to keep their favorites list accessible while listening. The setting is automatically saved, so your preference persists across sessions. Choose the workflow that suits you best—close on selection for a streamlined experience, or keep it open for continuous browsing.</p>
    
    <h3>Smart Station Pre-Selection</h3>
    <p>When you open the favorites search window, Live Beats WRP now  pre-selects the currently playing favorite station if one is active. This makes it easy to see which station you're listening to within your favorites list and provides a convenient starting point for browsing similar stations or switching to something new. The selection happens automatically, creating a more contextual and intuitive search experience.</p>
    
    <h3>Enhanced Now Playing Text Scrolling</h3>
    <p>Long messages in the media info window no longer get cut off or become unreadable. The "Now Playing" display now features automatic scrolling when text exceeds the available space, ensuring you can always read complete information no matter how lengthy. The scrolling is smooth and continuous making it easy to catch all the details about what's currently playing without any manual intervention.</p>
    
    <h3>Graceful Metadata Retry Handling</h3>
    <p>We've completely reworked the metadata retry function to be more respectful of streaming servers. Previously if metadata fetching failed the system could make repeated rapid requests that put unnecessary load on the server. The new implementation handles failures gracefully with intelligent backoff timing and preventing server hammering while still ensuring you get metadata updates when they become available. This improves both reliability and good network citizenship.</p>
    
    <h3>Fixed Data Usage Tracking</h3>
    <p>The "Data Used" label now correctly displays bandwidth consumption even when Live Beats defaults to estimating 160kbps bitrate for stations that don't provide explicit bitrate information. Previously the data usage wouldn't count in these scenarios, making it difficult to track your bandwidth consumption. This fix ensures accurate monitoring of your data usage across all station types, giving you better control and awareness of your network usage.</p>
    
    <div class="update-cta">
        <p>Version 0.7.9.4 focuses on making the favorites search experience more powerful and flexible while ensuring accurate metadata and data tracking. The random playback feature adds spontaneity to your listening, the persistent window option accommodates different browsing styles, and the pre-selection makes navigation more intuitive. Combined with the improved scrolling display and more reliable metadata handling this update enhances both discovery and reliability.</p>
        <p>Version 0.7.9.4 is available now for all users. Download the latest version from our <a href="download.html">download page</a>.</p>

            <h2>Version 0.7.9.0 Released: Custom Date Ranges, History Export & Enhanced User Experience</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">
                <div class="date">October 16, 2025</div>
                <div class="tag">Update</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.7.9.0 introduces powerful new database features that give you unprecedented control over your listening history. This release adds custom date range selection for statistics, seamless SLSK Manager integration, complete history export capabilities, and numerous refinements that enhance stability and user experience throughout the application.</p>
            
            <h3>Custom Date Range Selection for Statistics</h3>
            <p>The LB database now features flexible date range selection, allowing you to view your listening statistics for any specific time period. Whether you want to analyze your listening habits over the past week, compare different months, or review your entire history within a custom timeframe, the new date picker gives you complete control. This feature makes it easy to track how your music preferences evolve and identify your most-played stations during specific periods.</p>
            
            <h3>SLSK Manager Integration & History Export</h3>
            <p>We've added seamless integration with SLSK Manager directly from the history view. Right-click any song title in the LB Database history and you'll find a new option to add it directly to SLSK Manager, streamlining your workflow for finding and downloading tracks you've discovered while listening. Additionally, a new export button allows you to save your complete song title history to a text file with a single click. This makes it easy to keep backups of your listening history, share your discoveries with friends, or analyze your data in external applications.</p>
            
            <h3>Refined Muted Playback Notifications</h3>
            <p>Building on the auto-stop feature introduced in version 0.7.8.0, we've improved the user experience when playback has been muted for 30 minutes. Instead of an intrusive messagebox that demands immediate attention, the notification is now more subtle and less disruptive to your workflow. The player will stop gracefully with a notification that doesn't interrupt what you're doing, making the feature feel more natural and less jarring.</p>
            
            <h3>Enhanced Debug Tools & Volume Guidance</h3>
            <p>The debug information window has been upgraded with a refresh button that allows you to update diagnostics on demand, plus a clear errors button for managing your error log. When you attempt to start playback while your volume is set to 0%, Live Beats now displays a friendly reminder to increase your volume. This simple addition prevents confusion and helps new users understand why they can't hear audio, improving the overall onboarding experience.</p>
            
            <h3>Visual & UI Improvements</h3>
            <p>HTTP and HTTPS protocol icons have been slightly reduced in size to fit better within the user interface, creating a cleaner and more balanced visual appearance. These small refinements contribute to a more polished look throughout the application.</p>
            
            <h3>Label Scrolling Rework</h3>
            <p>Label scrolling behavior has been completely reworked for better usability. Scrolling text now automatically pauses when you hover your mouse over a label, allowing you to read station names, song titles, or other information without distraction. When you move your mouse away, scrolling resumes naturally. This intuitive behavior makes it much easier to interact with and read scrolling content throughout the application.</p>
            
            <h3>Stability & Code Quality Improvements</h3>
            <p>This release includes general code cleanup and refinement that improves overall maintainability and prepares the codebase for future enhancements. Form animation code has been reviewed and made more consistent, resulting in smoother transitions throughout the interface. We've fixed a critical issue where the error logging system could crash when handling missing information, ensuring that error tracking remains reliable even in unusual situations. The Copy and Save Song buttons now appear correctly when reconnecting to the same station, and we've enhanced thread safety in button visibility updates to prevent potential crashes during rapid state changes.</p>
            
            <div class="update-cta">
                <p>Version 0.7.9.0 focuses on giving you more control over your listening data while refining the overall user experience. The custom date range selection and history export features transform how you interact with your listening statistics, while the SLSK Manager integration creates a seamless workflow for music discovery. Combined with improved stability, better notifications, and the enhanced label scrolling behavior, this update makes Live Beats more powerful and pleasant to use.</p>

            <h2>Version 0.7.8.0 Released: Advanced Diagnostics, Enhanced Stability & Smart Playback Management</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">
                <div class="date">October 14, 2025</div>
                <div class="tag">Update</div>
            </div>

This release introduces powerful debug tools for monitoring application health, enhances the station renaming experience, and adds smart features to prevent unnecessary resource usage during extended muted playback sessions.</p>
            
            <h3>Advanced Debug Commands & Diagnostics</h3>
            <p>We've introduced a suite of debug commands that provide detailed insights into your Live Beats installation. You can now view comprehensive database and application information including file sizes, maintenance status, health metrics, and table statistics. These diagnostic tools help monitor the application's performance and identify potential issues before they impact your listening experience. Additionally, a new command allows you to clear accumulated error messages, while all errors are now automatically saved for later troubleshooting and analysis.</p>
            
            <h3>Enhanced Station Renaming Protection</h3>
            <p>The favorite station rename feature now includes protection against reserved system command names. This prevents accidental conflicts that could interfere with application functionality. If you attempt to use an invalid or duplicate station name, the application will now prompt you to try again with a helpful message, rather than forcing you to restart the entire renaming process. Error messages throughout the renaming workflow have been improved for better clarity and consistency, making the experience more user-friendly.</p>
            
            <h3>Fixed Radio Browser M3U Playlist Display</h3>
            <p>Station names from Radio Browser M3U playlists now display correctly throughout the application. This fix ensures consistent station identification whether you're browsing, playing, or managing your Radio Browser stations.</p>
            
            <h3>Improved Playback Stability</h3>
            <p>This release brings significant improvements to playback reliability and error handling. We've enhanced thread safety for UI updates, ensuring smoother visual transitions and eliminating potential race conditions that could affect the user interface. The metadata fetching system has been optimized for faster response times and more reliable song information display. Minor performance improvements to station label animations in the monitoring view result in smoother visual feedback during playback.</p>
            
            <h3>Smart Auto-Stop for Muted Playback</h3>
            <p>Live Beats now manages playback when you've muted the player for extended periods. If playback remains muted for 30 minutes while a station is still streaming, the application will automatically stop playback and present a prompt asking whether you'd like to resume the current station or keep it stopped. This feature prevents unnecessary bandwidth usage and system resources when you may have forgotten the player was running in the background.</p>
            
            <h3>Error Management & Troubleshooting</h3>
            <p>All errors encountered by the application are now systematically saved for later review and troubleshooting. This persistent error logging makes it easier to diagnose intermittent issues and provides valuable information for support requests. Combined with the new debug commands, you have comprehensive tools to monitor and maintain your Live Beats installation.</p>
            
            <div class="update-cta">
                <p>Version 0.7.8.0 represents a significant step forward in application reliability and user control. The diagnostic tools provide transparency into how Live Beats operates, while the stability improvements and smart playback management ensure a smoother, more efficient listening experience. The enhanced renaming system and fixed playlist display address key usability concerns raised by our community.</p>

            <h2>Version 0.7.6.6 Released: Enhanced Database Management & Real-Time Search</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">
                <div class="date">October 6, 2025</div>
                <div class="tag">Database Update</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.7.6.6 brings significant improvements to database management, search functionality, and user interface clarity. This release focuses on making station management more intuitive and efficient with new context menu options, enhanced auto-selection features, and real-time search capabilities.</p>
            
            <h3>New Context Menu Option</h3>
            <p>We've added a "Copy Station Name" option to the context menu in both Station Overview and History views. This makes it easier to quickly copy station names for sharing, documentation, or other purposes without needing to manually select and copy text from the interface.</p>
            
            <h3>Extended Auto-Selection Feature</h3>
            <p>The database now automatically selects non-favorite stations when they're playing, in addition to the existing favorite station selection. When you play a non-favorite station, the database will automatically highlight the corresponding "Non-favorites data usage" row (marked in green), making it easier to quickly view and manage statistics for any currently playing station regardless of its favorite status.</p>
            
            <h3>Real-Time Search Filtering</h3>
            <p>Search functionality in the database view has been significantly enhanced with real-time filtering. Results now filter instantly as you type, eliminating the need to press Enter or click the Search button. The Search button now doubles as a quick "Clear" button when filtering is active, providing a seamless search experience.</p>
            
            <h3>Improved Interface Clarity</h3>
            <p>We've changed the text from "Pin Window" to "Pin Player" for better clarity about what this feature actually does. The pin functionality keeps your player window always on top, and the new label makes this purpose more immediately understandable to users.</p>
            
            <h3>Interactive Copyright Label</h3>
            <p>The copyright label in the application is now clickable and includes a helpful tooltip. Clicking the label copies the support email address to your clipboard and displays a confirmation message, making it easier to reach out for support or feedback.</p>
            
            <h3>Registration System Improvements</h3>
            <p>We've made various enhancements to the registration system to improve security, reliability, and user experience. These improvements work behind the scenes to ensure smoother registration and licensing processes.</p>
            
            <h3>Database Security Patches</h3>
            <p>This release includes important security patches for the database system, ensuring your station data and listening statistics remain secure and protected.</p>
            
            <div class="update-cta">
                <p>These enhancements make station management more intuitive and efficient, particularly for power users who frequently work with both favorite and non-favorite stations. The real-time search functionality alone will save significant time when working with large station lists.</p>
                <p>Version 0.7.6.6 is available now for all users. Download the latest version from our <a href="download.html">download page</a>.</p>

            <h2>Version 0.7.6.0 Released: Performance Optimization & Smart Database Maintenance</h2>
    <div class="blog-meta">
        <div class="date">October 2, 2025</div>
        <div class="tag">Performance Update</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.7.6.0 introduces intelligent performance optimizations that work behind the scenes to keep your listening experience fast and responsive. This release focuses on server efficiency, database health, and streamlined user interface elements.</p>
    
    <h3>Optimized Server Caching</h3>
    <p>Radio station searches are now significantly faster thanks to enhanced server caching mechanisms. The application intelligently reduces file system access, resulting in quicker station discovery and improved overall responsiveness when browsing your favorite stations.</p>
    
    <h3>Streamlined Interface</h3>
    <p>The Import/Export favorites tooltip has been refined by removing the "Settings" reference. Since Live Beats now uses the database exclusively for all settings storage, this change provides clearer, more accurate information about what the import/export functionality actually handles.</p>
    
    <h3>Automatic Database Optimization</h3>
    <p>Perhaps the most significant addition in this version is the self-maintaining database system. Every 7 days, Live Beats automatically optimizes its database to maintain peak performance and responsiveness throughout extended usage.</p>
    
    <h3>Behind the Scenes: How Your App Stays Fast and Healthy</h3>
    <p>Ever notice how some apps start fast when you first install them, but over time they get slower, heavier, or even a little buggy? That usually happens because the app's database — the "brain" where all your information is stored — gets cluttered and needs cleaning.</p>
    
    <p>Live Beats WRP has a built-in self-maintenance system that takes care of this automatically, without you ever needing to push a button. Here's how it works, behind the scenes:</p>
    
    <h4>1. A Quick Check When You Start Listening</h4>
    <p>When you play a radio station for the first time in a session, Live Beats runs a quick internal check. This is like a warm-up routine — making sure everything is working correctly before you keep listening.</p>
    
    <h4>2. Weekly Database Maintenance</h4>
    <p>Once that first check is done, the app also looks at when it last performed database maintenance. If it's been more than seven days, it immediately starts a background cleanup.</p>
    
    <p>This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tidying up unused space so the database doesn't bloat unnecessarily</li>
        <li>Reorganizing data so it can be read more quickly</li>
        <li>Refreshing performance statistics so that Live Beats knows the best way to retrieve your information</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Think of it like reorganizing a messy filing cabinet — your documents are still there, but now they're easier and faster to find. And don't worry: all your favorites, themes, and settings remain safely saved during this process.</p>
    
    <h4>3. No Interruptions, No Popups</h4>
    <p>All of this happens silently. The app won't interrupt your music with popups or technical warnings. If maintenance is needed, it runs quietly in the background while you enjoy your radio station. Once it's complete, you'll see a small success message (about once every 7 days) letting you know the database has been optimized. This process was designed with you in mind: minimal impact and maximum benefit.</p>
    
    <h4>4. Smarter Scheduling</h4>
    <p>The app keeps track of the last time maintenance was done. If it's too soon to run again, it waits — ensuring the process only happens when it's actually needed.</p>
    
    <h4>5. Manual Maintenance (Optional)</h4>
    <p>If you ever want to run database maintenance yourself, you can do so from the Database window in the app. Most users will never need this since the process happens automatically in the background — but if you want to, running it manually won't hurt anything. It's just an extra tune-up on demand.</p>
    
    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    
    <h4>Do I need to run this myself?</h4>
    <p>Nope! Maintenance happens automatically every 7 days. The manual option is there if you want to use it, but it's not required.</p>
    
    <h4>Will this slow down my computer while I'm listening?</h4>
    <p>Not noticeably. The process is designed to be quick and silent. In most cases, you won't even know it's happening.</p>
    
    <h4>Why does it trigger when I play a radio station?</h4>
    <p>Because that's the moment the app knows you're actively using it. It's the perfect time to check if maintenance is due without slowing things down during loading.</p>
    
    <h4>What's the benefit for me as a listener?</h4>
    <p>Faster load times, smoother playback, and a database that doesn't grow unnecessarily large. Basically, your app stays just as responsive as the day you first installed it.</p>
    
    <h4>What if something goes wrong during maintenance?</h4>
    <p>The process is designed to fail silently — meaning if there's ever a rare issue, the app won't interrupt your listening experience.</p>
    
    <h4>Do I need to wait until maintenance is done before I exit Live Beats?</h4>
    <p>No. If you close the app during maintenance, it will simply stop and pick up again later when needed. You don't have to keep the app open for it to complete.</p>
    
    <div class="update-cta">
        <p>In short: the next time you hit "play" on your favorite radio station, know that the app is quietly working behind the scenes to keep itself fast, clean, and optimized — and if you ever feel like giving it a little extra boost, you can run maintenance manually anytime from the Database window.</p>

            <h3>Enhancing User Experience: Adding an Integrated Search Button to Favorites</h3>
            <p>One of the most requested features from our users has been the ability to quickly search through your favorite radio stations. Today, we're excited to share how we implemented a sleek, integrated search button that transforms your favorites management.</p>
            
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>Standard dropdown menus work great for short lists, but when you have hundreds of favorites finding what you want becomes tedious. Users were constantly scrolling through lengthy favorites lists, and the built-in type-ahead functionality wasn't quite cutting it for complex search scenarios.</p>
            
            <h3>The Solution: Integrated Search Button</h3>
            <p>We developed a custom search button that appears seamlessly integrated into the favorites dropdown and now finding your favorite station among hundreds of favorites becomes easy and quick. Once you find the station you just double click to start playing.</p>
            
            <h3>Smart Functionality</h3>
            <p>Maintains dropdown functionality - your original favorites menu still works perfectly. Added through checks for valid favorites imports and URLs used in the player.</p>
            
            <h3>Application Improvements</h3>
            <p><strong>Memory Management Enhancement:</strong> Fixed several potential memory leak issues where system resources weren't being properly released when the application closed. This prevents the app from consuming unnecessary memory and improves overall system performance.</p>
            
            <h3>Station Monitoring System Improvements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Random Timing Improvements:</strong> Updated how the app generates random intervals between metadata checks. The previous method was inefficient and could produce poor randomization. Now uses a more efficient approach that provides better distribution of update times.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Cleanup Architecture:</strong> Implemented multiple cleanup points throughout the application: immediate cleanup when features are disabled, comprehensive cleanup when closing forms, and automatic cleanup for temporary operations.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This ensures system resources are freed as soon as they're no longer needed, rather than waiting until the application exits.</p>
            
            <h3>Overall Impact</h3>
            <p>These improvements make the application more responsive, stable, and efficient with system resources. Users should notice smoother operation, especially when using the station monitoring features with multiple stations active simultaneously.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>We're excited to announce Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.6.1.0, a focused quality-of-life update that addresses user feedback and enhances the daily listening experience.

            <h3>Improved User Interface Responsiveness</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Non-Modal About Dialog:</strong> The About dialog is now non-modal, allowing you to continue using the main player interface while viewing version information and changelog details.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Button Focus:</strong> Disabled buttons now bring focus to the interface instead of being completely unresponsive, providing better visual feedback and maintaining interface responsiveness even when certain functions are temporarily unavailable.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Clearer Favorite Station Playback</h3>
            <p>When playing Radio Browser stations that are already in your favorites, you now get clear, accurate options: play from favorites without reporting to the Radio Browser API, or play from favorites while also reporting the vote to the API. Both options ensure your listening statistics are properly tracked, with the choice simply determining whether to contribute data back to the Radio Browser community.</p>
            
            <p>Version 0.6.1.0 builds on the solid foundation of 0.6.0.0 with these targeted improvements that make daily radio listening more intuitive and efficient. These refinements ensure every interaction feels natural and responsive while maintaining the robust stability and feature completeness that defines Live Beats WebRadio Player.</p>

            </ul>
            
            <h3>Immediate Favorites Tracking</h3>
            <p>Fixed the frustrating issue where adding a station to favorites required restarting the station to begin proper tracking. Station tracking now immediately switches from non-favorite to favorite mode the moment you add a station to your favorites list. Additionally, imported favorite stations are now properly tracked without requiring an application restart, making the favorites system truly seamless.</p>
            
            <h3>Refined Import Experience</h3>
            <p>The settings panel will no longer unexpectedly open when performing drag-and-drop operations to import favorites files. The panel now only closes after import if it was already open before the operation, maintaining a cleaner and more predictable user interface behavior.</p>
            
            <h3>Polish & Professional Appearance</h3>
            <p>Removed the distracting focus rectangles that appeared on buttons when switching between applications, creating a cleaner, more professional appearance that maintains visual consistency regardless of application focus state.</p>
            
            <p>Version 0.5.6.0 demonstrates our dedication to delivering enterprise-level stability and reliability in a consumer-friendly package. These improvements address the core issues that affect daily usage, ensuring Live Beats WebRadio Player provides the smooth, dependable experience you deserve.</p>

            <p>We're thrilled to announce the release of Live Beats WebRadio Player version 0.4.8.0, delivering significant improvements to duplicate song detection, enhanced favorites management, and personalized user interactions that make your radio listening experience more intelligent and enjoyable.</p>
            
            <h3>Improved Duplicate Song Detection</h3>
            <p>Our most significant enhancement in this release is the completely revamped duplicate song detection system. The new intelligent algorithm now catches typos, different formatting variations, and even artist/title order swaps while being smart enough to avoid false positives for legitimate remixes and collaborations. This means you'll get accurate duplicate detection without losing track of different versions of your favorite songs.</p>
            
            <h3>Seamless Favorites Management</h3>
            <p>We've streamlined the favorites experience with instant updates. Adding a station to favorites now immediately updates the favorite status without requiring a station restart, providing a smooth, uninterrupted listening experience while you organize your preferred stations.</p>
            
            <h3>Top Favorites Priority System</h3>
            <p>Introducing the new "Top Favorites" functionality that allows you to designate priority favorites within your favorites collection. This feature gives you even more control over how your most-loved stations are organized and accessed, making it easier to quickly find your absolute top choices.</p>
            
            <h3>Personalized User Greetings</h3>
            <p>Registered users will now be welcomed with personalized greeting messages when loading the player. This small but meaningful touch creates a more personal connection with the application and acknowledges your membership in the Live Beats community.</p>
            
            <h3>Enhanced Song Title Management</h3>
            <p>We've resolved issues with copying and saving scrolling song titles, ensuring that you can now properly capture and save track information even when the title text is scrolling due to length. This improvement makes it easier to keep track of songs you discover during your listening sessions.</p>
            
            <p>Version 0.4.8.0 represents our continued commitment to refining the user experience through intelligent automation and thoughtful interface improvements that respect both your time and your listening preferences.</p>

            </div>

            <p>We've made significant technical improvements to the core streaming and metadata systems in version 0.3.7.0, released on April 12, 2025. These changes enhance reliability and performance, especially during long listening sessions.</p>

                <div class="date">April 11, 2025</div>
                <div class="tag">Feature</div>
            </div>
     
            <p>Version 0.3.6.0 brings several enhancements to our LB Database functionality, making it easier to find and manage your stations while tracking usage data more comprehensively.</p>
            
            <h3>Database Enhancements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Station Search:</strong> Added the ability to search for stations directly within the database, making it easier to find favorites in large collections.</li>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive Data Tracking:</strong> Non-favorite stations now track data usage too, giving you complete visibility into your listening habits.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Data Management:</strong> Deleting a station from favorites will automatically add its data usage to "Non-favorites data usage" to maintain accurate statistics.</li>
                <li><strong>Visual Improvements:</strong> "Non-favorites data usage" now displays in light green color for easier identification, and the UI has received several small adjustments for better usability.</li>
                <li><strong>Focused Statistics:</strong> When viewing usage statistics for specific dates, only stations that were actually played during that period will be shown, reducing clutter.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We've also added a confirmation message when enabling or disabling statistics tracking to prevent accidental changes that might affect your usage data (version 0.3.6.2).</p>
            
            <h3>Theme Designer Additions</h3>
            <p>For theme customization enthusiasts, we've added two new buttons in the theme designer:</p>

            <p>We've enhanced the visual experience in version 0.3.5.0 with two significant improvements:</p>
            
            <h3>Theme Consistency</h3>
            <p>Themes will now apply to all forms and windows throughout the application. Previously, some dialogs and panels might not have fully adopted your selected theme, creating visual inconsistency. Now your chosen theme will be applied everywhere for a cohesive experience.</p>
            
            <h3>Smooth Transitions</h3>
            <p>All forms now have a fade-in effect for a more polished and professional feel. Rather than windows appearing instantly, they'll smoothly transition into view, reducing visual jarring when opening new panels or dialogs.</p>
            
            <p>These subtle but important visual improvements contribute to a more refined and professional application experience.</p>

            <h3>The LB Database</h3>

                <li><strong>Better Preview:</strong> Improved visual feedback when designing themes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We've also improved memory management and resource cleanup throughout the application, and in version 0.3.3.1, we've added proper error dialogs that will show Windows crash information if an unexpected error occurs.</p>
